## TrollCall Display v1.0.0

The main font for TrollCall's titles, replacing Krona One.
Is made to type in English script when put in ALL CAPS, and Alternian script when put into lowercase.

Does not support display of dashes, percent signs, dollar signs, carat symbols, ampersands, or quotation marks, yet. None of these punctuation would be commonly found in a title on TrollCall, anyway.

## IrkenSimplified v2.12.1

The will given to me by God to slap my dumbass during the ALOIRP days is strong. Enjoy the font, I guess.

[ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION]

The Irken Simplified language, all adjusted and reached into a
NORMAL FONT, so YOU can start REGRETTING YOUR LIFE NOW!!!!!!
Use it on your computer, Use it on a document, anything but I bet YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT!!!
At least I can't...


:(
Anyway, this is GitHub, so feel free to edit my font and adjust it! Or, use it for free on tens of thousands of opprotunities!
Do anything! I'm not being paid by this! :)
